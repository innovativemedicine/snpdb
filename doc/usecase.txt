Our use case:

- fast aggregation and range queries on all data, with index support for fields
  - range queries:
    - SNPs within a chromosome, basepair range
  - index query:
    - SNPs in some set of genes
- good join performance with at least 5 tables OR support for nested data structures (e.g. lists) 
  that allows denormalization of numerical data
  - list of tables in relational schema (for reference)
    - vc
    - vc_genotype
    - vc_allele
    - vc_group
    - vc_group_allele
- data life cycle
  - bulk load sometimes
  - bulk update sometimes (same size as a previous load?)
    - why: various statistics (in INFO) are calculated per vc_group; if an additional sample was 
      added to a vc_group, these statistics need to be updated
  - all-data read frequently (within some range query) 
- scalability
  - must scale to terabytes of data
